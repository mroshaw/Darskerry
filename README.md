# "Darskerry" by Daft Apple Games

This project, working title "Darskerry", is my first foray into game development. The project uses Unity and the High Definition Render Pipleline (HDRP).

The game is a 3rd person story adventure, set on the island of "Darskerry" - a play on words, based on the Scottish word "skerry" meaning "island", and the "dark" foreboding nature of the game.

The objective of the project is to learn game dev, and the Unity platform, creating as many of the systems as possible from scratch. That said, the project does rely on a number of 3rd party assets that are required in order to build the game. For obvious reasons, these are not included in this repository.
